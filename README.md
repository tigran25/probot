[![npm version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/probot.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/probot) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/probot/probot.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/probot/probot) [![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/probot/probot.svg)](https://greenkeeper.io/)

If you've ever thought, "wouldn't it be cool if GitHub couldâ€¦"; imma stop you right there. Most features can actually be added via [GitHub Apps](https://developer.github.com/apps/), which extend GitHub and can be installed directly on organizations and user accounts and granted access to specific repositories. They come with granular permissions and built-in webhooks. Apps are first class actors within GitHub.

**Probot is a framework for building [GitHub Apps](http://developer.github.com/apps) in [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)**. Check out some of the [featured apps](https://probot.github.io/apps) or learn more about [writing a new app](https://probot.github.io/docs/).

## Contributing

Probot is built by people just like you! Most of the interesting things are built _with_ Probot, so consider starting by [writing a new app](https://probot.github.io/docs/) or improving one of the [existing ones](https://github.com/search?q=topic%3Aprobot-app&type=Repositories), and check out our [contributing docs](CONTRIBUTING.md) for other ways to get started.
